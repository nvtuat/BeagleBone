BBB console can be reached by using the following command:

ssh 192.168.7.2 -l root

In the BBB console,  type the following:

ifconfig usb0 192.168.7.2
route add default gw 192.168.7.1
 

In the linux console of host system, type:

sudo su
#wlan0 is my internet facing interface, eth5 is the BeagleBone USB connection
ifconfig eth5 192.168.7.1
iptables --table nat --append POSTROUTING --out-interface wlan0 -j MASQUERADE
iptables --append FORWARD --in-interface eth5 -j ACCEPT
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

If the network is not accessible,type the following in BBB terminal:

echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" >> /etc/resolv.conf
 

Note: Assuming that wlan0 of the host system should be shared with USB-Ethernet eth5. 
User may change these configuration to match their interface names.

Now the network can be accessed using the BBB.
